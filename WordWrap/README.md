My program is a finished product, it does what the problem statement asks it to do without any bugs that I have been able to find.

The program uses an input scanner to access user input line by line, and then uses a separate line scanner to break that line down into individual words, and output them on separate lines if need be. The main loop of the program is a while loop that runs while the user doesn't input "Stop." In this loop, the program loops through all the words in a user's input line. During each iteration of the loop, the words are added to a buffer for an individual line. If the length of the line buffer exceeds the max line length that the user inputs, then the program adds the line to a buffer that stores the total output of the program. If there is a blank line, the program first checks if there is any holdover text from previous iterations that didn't meet the max length requirement. If there is, it outputs that text to a line and then outputs the blank line to the buffer. If not, it just outputs the blank line to the buffer and keeps iterating through the user input. The last thing in the loop is a check to see if the program is about to be stopped. If it is, the program dumps the remaining data onto an individual line in the buffer before the loop ends. The final step is to print the buffer to output.
